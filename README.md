# CodingQuiz


## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to make a javascript quiz that uses html/css/javascript together as a Web API. This was a very difficult task for me.
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* How to getelement by id. queryselector to communicate with html with javascript
* set an interval timer and clear interval
* better understanding of javascript functions.
* The set attribute remove attribute in javascript
* text.content usage
* how to use the hidden class.
* better understanding of javascript objects
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* lots of difficulty knowing where to start. Received lots of help from TA's, tutor ASKBCS
* getting functions to do what I wanted.
* being able to grasp what is going down. hard time breaking things down
* solving the entire coding challenge..
